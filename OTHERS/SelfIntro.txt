Hello! My name is Madhav Sameer, and I’m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Centurion University of Technology and Management, where I maintain a CGPA of 8.56. I am a proficient software developer with expertise in both MERN stack and Java Full-stack architecture.

I’ve had the opportunity to work as a Software Development Intern at Codtech IT Solutions, where I developed a Java-based vehicle booking system that improved booking efficiency and helped reduce paper waste. I also worked on a Spring Boot Smart Library Management system, enhancing book handling efficiency by 25%. Additionally, I’ve interned as a Web Development Intern at Oasis Infobyte, where I built a real-time chat application using Socket.io and improved file load times with MongoDB and Cloudinary.

Some of my key projects include an Online Tutorial System using Spring Boot and React.js, a Cloud Kitchen Platform utilizing the MERN stack with JWT authentication, and my personal Blogging Application built with Firebase and MERN stack, which boosted user engagement by 50%.

I am skilled in languages like Java, JavaScript, C, and Python, and I’m proficient in tools such as Git, Postman, AWS, and Google Cloud. I have a strong foundation in data structures, networking, and database management, and I’m passionate about clean code, performance optimization, and scalable solutions.

I’ve also participated in several hackathons, securing 1st rank in the Smart India Hackathon at my university, and completed Google Cloud Computing courses.

In addition to my technical skills, I’m a strong communicator and team collaborator, always eager to learn and keep up with industry trends.
